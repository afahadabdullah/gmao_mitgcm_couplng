* Current
  - JMC/CH/AT. Adding some export variables for passing things to plot in parent levels.
  - JMC/CH. Creating reference experiment that can be used to verify basic 


* Over next 3 months


* Experiment ideas
  - run llc90 (ECCOv4) with MERRA-[12] atmospheric state bc's and optimize (hand, GF, adjoint)
     uncertain ocean boundary layer scheme parameters, initial conditions, parameterization coeffs
     etc.. to keep trajectory close to ECCOv4 solution.
