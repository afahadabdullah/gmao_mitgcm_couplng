goals:
- examine Udi's GEOS_MIT_51, generate plots
- repeat the first week or month, and check in instructions in
  gmao_mitgcm_couplng/experiments/c90_llc90_clim/clim01
- then carry out a 30-year 1992 perpetual year run
- then carry out a 30-year 2020 perpetual year run
- then carry out a 1992-2020 run


/nobackup/estrobac/geos5/GEOS_MIT_51
Udi's long integration with Green's functions paper parameters
perpetual year 2000, 60+ years of simulation

/nobackup/estrobac/geos5/GEOS_MIT_52
Udi's long integration with alternate set of parameters
(time-mean constraints as opposed to seasonal mean, or vice versa)

- Udi's GEOS_MIT_51(optimized) has sea-ice bug (double minus sign in import_state_fill_mod.FOR). Next step is: copy the same sandbox (Heracles-5_4_c90_llc90_02a_48_NOFIX_OPT_10y), fix the sea-ice bug, recompile, clone GEOS_MIT_51 experiment as Udi's with new executable, and run for 30 years. 

- Compare New run with Udi's GEOS_MIT_51 experiment to see how the sea-ice bug affects the experiment.
