- Verify and correct units, location, and rotation of fluxes
  imported by MITgcm from GEOS-5 atmosphere.

- Does uVel and vVel need to be rotated in export_state_fill_mod.FOR ?

- First 4 time steps of SWHEAT (QSW.000007200[0-3].data) are zeros.
  See explanation and fix in notes.txt

- Automatic Makefile creation for MITgcm build

- Automatic generation of gmao_mitgcm_couplng/mitgcm_setup/inc

- Make g5_modules more compatible among platforms
  by moving coupling parameters to instructions
  or set_mitgcm_env.sh

- Instructions for running on NAS and engaging

- Cleaner, more concise instructions

- Better testing

- Revisit whether -O1 is needed for GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90
  (the same compiler error seems to also happen when the
   compiler runs out of core memory on the virtual box)

- Work towards more flexible MITgcm tile decomposition.
  For example, "sNx=16,sNy=32" will work, but
  "sNx=32,sNy=16" will export distorted fields.

- llc90 and llc270 configurations

- runoff is missing in QFLX
  Will need to be specified separately in MITgcm or obtained from
  MIT_GEOS5PlugMod.F90 DISCHARGE (river_discharge_at_ocean_points).

- Handle enthalpy exchange:
  one other note: the enthalpy in mom is apparantly not impacted by the
  precip, its done in some other way that i don't know now.
  (jean michel, i have images of the "temperature of the rain" discussions
  with john and alistair..... cracks me up to remember....)

- Add dynamic/thermodynamics sea ice

- Code is not thread-safe, e.g., mythid is hard-coded to 1 in
  eeboot_minimal.F and in "CALL EXCH_UV_AGRID_3D_RL".
  Will we ever need to use thread-safe code for coupled set-up?

- Find out why code crashes when "pLoad(i,j,bi,bj)=p%PS(iSLo+i,jSLo+j)"
  is uncommented in import_state_fill_mod.FOR
