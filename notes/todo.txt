- Make MITgcm imprt variables active by completing import_state_fill_mod.FOR
  (export_state_fill_mod.FOR can be used as template)
  Lines 546-554 in MIT_GEOS5PlugMod.F90 and driver_set_import_state.FOR
  contain the list of imported variables.

- First 4 time steps of SWHEAT (QSW.000007200[0-3].data) are zeros.
  See explanation and fix in notes.txt

- Automatic Makefile creation for MITgcm build

- Automatic generation of gmao_mitgcm_couplng/mitgcm_setup/inc

- Make g5_modules more compatible among platforms
  by moving coupling parameters to instructions
  or set_mitgcm_env.sh

- Instructions for running on NAS and engaging

- Cleaner, more concise instructions

- Better testing

- Revisit whether -O1 is needed for GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90
  (the same compiler error seems to also happen when the
   compiler runs out of core memory on the virtual box)

- Work towards more flexible MITgcm tile decomposition.
  For example, "sNx=16,sNy=32" will work, but
  "sNx=32,sNy=16" will export distorted fields.
