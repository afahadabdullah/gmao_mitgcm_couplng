- complete exchange variable list

  For the "first-draft" coupling, I would like to see all of the
  output fields (US, VS, SS) to be set. Look at lines 564-568 in the
  MIT_Plug. The actual code that sets them is in
  mitgcm_setup/code_split_driver/driver_get_export_state.FOR. All of
  these variables are 2d, and you can see around line 35 there is "if"
  block to handle TS, but the rest is stubbed.

  Similarly, for the import from GEOS-5, only TAUX and TAUY are
  handled by driver_set_import_state.FOR. But the list is much larger:
  check lines 546-554 in MIT_Plug (the LATS abd LONS are actually only
  for debugging)

- automatic Makefile creation for MITgcm build

- automatic generation of gmao_mitgcm_couplng/mitgcm_setup/inc

- make g5_modules more compatible among platforms
  by moving coupling parameters to instructions
  or set_mitgcm_env.sh

- instructions for running on NAS and engaging

- cleaner, more concise instructions

- better testing

- revisit whether -O1 is needed for GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90
  (the same compiler error seems to also happen when the
   compiler runs out of core memory on the virtual box)
