- complete 3d mask + exchange variable list

- automatic Makefile creation for MITgcm build

- automatic generation of gmao_mitgcm_couplng/mitgcm_setup/inc

- make g5_modules more compatible among platforms
  by moving coupling parameters to instructions
  or set_mitgcm_env.sh

- instructions for running on NAS

- cleaner, more concise instructions

- better testing

- revisit whether -O1 is needed for GEOS_MoistGridComp.F90
  (the same compiler error seems to also happen when the
   compiler runs out of core memory on the virtual box)
