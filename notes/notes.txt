11/19/2016: SFLX
'SFLX',  'salt_flux_from_skin_to_ocean',          'N m-2',

I am guessing that when there is evaporation:
(i) "salty water" flows into the skin layer from the ocean,
(ii) freshwater flows from skin layer to atmosphere, and
(iii) salt flows from skin layer to ocean.

If SFLX is this third component of evaporation, it can be ignored for driving
MITgcm since MITgcm only exports freshwater from ocean during evaporation.
But SFLUX has both positive and negative numbers, so above decomposition may not be correct.

Another detail that we will need to worry about later on is that in the presence of sea-ice
the MITgcm exports “salty water” to the ice and then rejects some of that salt back to
the ocean.  Also, the unit of SFLX specified in MIT_GEOS5PlugMod.F90 seem wrong.
They probably should be g/m^2/s instead of N/m^2.

For time being set MITgcm deltaT to be identical to HEARTBEAT_DT

11/16/2016: First 4 time steps of SWHEAT are zeros

I would not worry too much about the 1-hour "delay" in SWHEAT. This is
strictly an artifact of the current setup. Here is a full disclosure:

In GEOS-5 radiation process(es) (both SW and IR) are computationally
expensive, and we have made a decision to not do "full" calculation
every time step. Instead we keep an internal state, which is updated
once an hour, and every time step we make a correction to account for
the movement of the Sun. This procedure works fine and we like the
results. To have everything working as designed, we need a "full" set
of restarts. If we do not have all of the required restarts, we allow
the so-called bootstrapping (i.e. few of the restarts are required and
the rest are generated by the model in few time steps). At the end of
the run the model creates a full set of restarts, which are meant to
be used for the next run.

As you remember very very, Matt gave us a set of boundary conditions
and restarts for few grid resolutions ("tiny.tgz"). These contain only
the required restarts (and solar radiation restart is not one of
them). Therefore until the first full solar update (done at the bottom
of every hour), solar internal state contains zero (ONLY for a
bootstrapped run). After that, everything should be fine.

So, here are two possibilities for a test:
1) Once you made a successful run, save the restarts (*_checkpoint
files). Rename them *_rst, place them where the rest of the restarts
are (typically one level above scratch, where gcm_run.j is) and start
a new run. Technically for SWHEAT issue you would need only
solar_internal_rst, so you do not overwrite the original restarts.

2) Alternatively, if you comment out SOLAR_DR and IRRAD_DT lines in
AGCM.rc, radiation would do full calculations every time step, and you
do not need the solar_internal_rst. The run would be slower though

I recommend, that you test 1) and/or 2). If SWHEAT behaves as
expected, do not make any changes to setup, since this will NOT be an
issue for continuous run

11/9/2016: First draft coupling

For the "first-draft" coupling, I would like to see all of the output
fields (US, VS, SS) to be set. Look at lines 564-568 in the
MIT_Plug. The actual code that sets them is in
mitgcm_setup/code_split_driver/driver_get_export_state.FOR. All of
these variables are 2d, and you can see around line 35 there is "if"
block to handle TS, but the rest is stubbed.

Similarly, for the import from GEOS-5, only TAUX and TAUY are handled
by driver_set_import_state.FOR. But the list is much larger: check
lines 546-554 in MIT_Plug (the LATS abd LONS are actually only for
debugging)
