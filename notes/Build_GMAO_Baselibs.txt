# Instructions for building GMAO Baselibs (4_0_7) on Lubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
# First make sure that all needed packages are installed, e.g.,
# as per instructions in dimitris_notes/Lubuntu*_on_VirtualBox.txt
 tcsh
 setenv WorkingDir ~/geos5
 mkdir $WorkingDir
# Link or build GEOS-5 baselibs in $WorkingDir
#   GMAO-Baselibs-4_0_7.withNewCDO.tgz is available in
#   engaging:/nobackup1/dmenemen/geos5/tarballs_100816
#   discover:/discover/nobackup/dmenemen/geos5/tarballs_100816
# Note that if Baselibs is moved to a different location, it needs
# to be rebuilt (or linked to old location). This is because
# netCDF libraries and LD paths are provided by
# "nf_config --flibs" based on netCDF installation directory.
